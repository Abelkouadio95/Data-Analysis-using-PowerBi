# Data-Analysis-using-PowerBi
In this repository, you will find a collection of data analysis projects using **Power BI**, and occasionally **Python**, **SQL**, and other tools.  
These projects aim to transform raw data into actionable insights through interactive dashboards and clear visualizations.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Overview
Each project generally follows these key steps:

1. **Data Collection**  
   Gathering datasets from various sources (Excel, databases, web, APIs, etc.).

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
   - Handling missing or inconsistent data  
   - Formatting columns and values  
   - Using Power Query or Python (Pandas) for preprocessing

3. **Data Modeling**  
   - Establishing relationships between tables  
   - Creating calculated columns and measures (DAX)  
   - Normalizing the data model for performance and clarity

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - Designing interactive dashboards in Power BI  
   - Choosing the right visuals (charts, maps, tables, KPIs)  
   - Implementing slicers, filters, and drill-throughs for dynamic exploration

5. **Analysis & Insights**  
   - Interpreting the visualized data  
   - Identifying trends, outliers, and key metrics  
   - Drawing business conclusions

6. **Documentation & Sharing**  
   - Publishing reports to Power BI Service  
   - Adding descriptions and context  
   - Sharing with stakeholders or via GitHub

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- **Power BI**
- **Power Query**
- **DAX**
- **SQL**
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)** â€“ in some cases
